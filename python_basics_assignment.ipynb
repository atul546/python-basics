        "    . When to use: When you know the number of iterations in advance or you are iterating over a collection (like a list or range).\n",
        "    .Control: The loop automatically handles the iteration, and you don't need to manually update the loop variable. 2.while Loop Purpose: The while loop continues executing as long as the given condition is True.\n",

        "# ans = A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is - not known in advance and the loop should continue as long as a certain condition is true.

        "    . Explanation: The while loop continues to ask for the password until the user enters the correct one.\n",
        "    . The condition (user_input != password) is checked each time, and the loop keeps running until the condition becomes False (i.e., the user enters the correct password).\n",
        "    . The number of iterations is not predefined, making the while loop the ideal choice for this scenario\n",
        "    . Why a for loop wouldn't be suitable: A for loop is typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance, such as iterating over a list or range. In this case, since we don't know how many times the user will attempt to enter the password, a for loop isn't ideal unless you explicitly set a fixed number of attempts.\n",
